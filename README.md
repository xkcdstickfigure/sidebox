# Sidebox
Create instant email inboxes for signing up to things

### Why should I use this?
- Make multiple accounts on the same service
- Stop companies knowing your real email and tracking you across the internet with it
- Completely avoid spam - messages are in a separate email inbox that you can just delete

### Why is this better than services like 10minutemail?
You can create multiple email inboxes and they last forever (unless you delete them). This means you won't get locked out of accounts you make if you forget the email or password, or need an email 2fa code.

### Why is this better than username+somethingâ€‹@gmail.com?
Companies can still easily figure out your normal email address, and it's not as easy to block them. With Sidebox, all they get is a random identifier, and once you delete it, it's useless.
